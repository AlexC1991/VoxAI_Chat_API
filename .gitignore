# Large binaries (Optional - keep if you want portability, remove if you want clean repo)
# For this specific project, user wanted it "up to scruff for integration", 
# but usually we don't commit 55MB DLLs. 
# I will NOT ignore them by default as they seem core to the "Portable" nature, 
# but models must be ignored.
